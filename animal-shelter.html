    <p>Animals complete a circle in human being life. An animal shelter or
      pound is a place where stray, lost, abandoned or surrendered animals – mostly
      dogs and cats – are housed. The word "pound" has its origins in the animal pounds
      of agricultural communities, where stray livestock would be penned or impounded
      until they were claimed by their owners.</p>
      <p>Currently, it is estimated that there are approximately 5,000 independently-run
        animal shelters operating nationwide.[13] Shelters have redefined their role since
        the 1990s. No longer serving as a lifelong repository for strays and drop-offs,
        modern shelters have taken the lead in controlling the pet population, promoting
        pet adoption and studying shelter animals' health and behavior. To prevent animal
        euthanization, some shelters offer behavioral assessments of animals and training
        classes to make them more adoptable to the public. Most shelters also provide medical
        care that includes spaying and neutering to prevent overpopulation.</p>
